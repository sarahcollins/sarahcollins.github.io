Right now I’m using research, analytics and social listening to create <a href="http://todo.chicago.com/" target="_blank">To Do Chicago</a>, an urban exploration site that's driven by user insights. Drawing on current market trends and my past experiences creating content for this audience, my team and I designed To Do to reach twenty-somethings who are just starting to figure out who they are as adults and as Chicagoans. We aim to engage our audience by connecting them with their true Chicago. To maximize limited resources, we measure each piece of content against that mission, making sure it surprises our audience with something great and provides enough information and context to make it accessible. Then we deliver that content in the voice of a trusted friend, aligning our headline writing, social strategy and image selection to present To Do as an ally for exploration.

On the business end, I make sure the partnerships we form and businesses we build support and are supported by our content strategy. I select affiliate partners based on the information and utility they can bring to our readers. I select vendors for our upcoming e-commerce store based on how relevant they are to our users. I approach content partners that can extend our reach outside of our current areas of expertise, so our users can form a deeper connection to Chicago. And I create marketing collateral that introduces our mission to new users, from a college guide stuffed with tips and passed out to new students to cheeky house ads that show how exploring Chicago can be a great and sometimes weird way to spend your time.

At <a href="https://twitter.com/Grid_Chicago" target="_blank">Grid</a> I created a tip-to-tail digital strategy that helped the niche business publication reach a monthly audience of 130,000 savvy Chicagoans with little budget and no marketing. I trained the whole team on optimizing headlines for social, maximizing SEO metadata and selecting stories and beats based on past analytics. In the end we had a well-oiled machine that produced content our users wanted to see and packaged it up in ways that engaged them. Together we shaped a savvy brand voice that provided a bit of real talk in Chicago business coverage. The project was ultimately closed due to business decisions, but our legacy lives on — mostly because our competitors adopted a few of our tactics and picked up a few of our freelancers.

    <p>
When I started out at the <a href="http://www.avclub.com/" target="_blank">A.V. Club</a>, the Onion’s entertainment sister site, headlines were a single noun and analytics were regarded with deep suspicion. I worked with the staff to explain what traffic insights could do for them, and to move them to a descriptive headline writing style that maximized traffic. The better headlines did a lot to help our social strategy, but I also used social analytics and feedback from our users to build out multi-channel social campaigns. We went from just promoting our content to promoting our brand as a kind of nerd heaven. By sharing our office antics and highlighting the personalities of our staffers, we were able to give our fans a sense of community that kept them coming back to the site an obsessive amount.
    </p>
    <p>
My understanding of the A.V. Club community also earned me a place on the team creating content, event and social strategies for advertisers trying to reach our users. In that position, I was able to ensure that campaigns met advertiser needs without sacrificing our relationship with our audience. Several projects that our readers loved, like the Parameter film festival, would have never gotten off the ground without our team’s ability to work with advertisers looking to extend their brands’ reach.
