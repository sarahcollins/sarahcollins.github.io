<h2>Digital Strategy | Content Marketing | Audience Engagement</h2>    

    <p>Whether I’m stepping into a startup as a one-woman marketing department or consulting on an email campaign to boost open rates, I bring value to companies by putting the focus back on the user. Every communication is a two-way street, with feedback coming in the form of analytics that can be used to improve the next round. By testing and iterating until I know exactly what users want to see and how they want to see it, I create content marketing with real ROI.
    </p>
    <p>
<a href="http://gethustl.in/" target="_blank">Get Hustlin’</a>, the career brand I co-founded, is the purest example of my approach to user acquisition and audience engagement. We know from years of experience in business journalism that most users are focused on only one thing — how to get a better job. So each week we sort through the news to deliver only what will help them succeed in their careers. We chose a newsletter as the primary format, because we know inboxes create a private space where users can admit to being unhappy at work, and where they can share information without embarrassing their friends by tacking it to their wall. A tightly controlled brand voice lets us communicate to the users in the way the want to be talked to, reminding them that they are smart, capable and deserving of more. By keeping a laser focus on user needs, we’ve built a devoted following of people who need confidence just as badly as they need a new job.

   <p>
       My media experience with companies like <em>The Onion</em>, <em>Crain’s Chicago Business</em> and <em>The Chicago Sun-Times</em> has taught me to turn out authentic, valuable content that connects with users. My digital experience with agencies and corporate clients has taught me how to package it, deliver it and track it to get the most advantageous impact. My startup experience has taught me how to do all that quickly and while handling anything else that may come my way. If you’re looking for a better way to find and communicate with your users, please get in touch.
