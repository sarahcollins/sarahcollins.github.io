<h2>Digital Strategy | Content Marketing | Audience Engagement</h2>    

    <p>Whether I’m working with a healthcare startup to hone an email campaign or a college system to overhaul an entire digital strategy, I bring value to companies by putting the focus back on users. I learn who they are, what they want and how they want to be talked to, then I create a brand voice that engages them and a digital strategy that reaches them. And that’s just step one. Each communication is an opportunity to learn more from analytics. By testing and iterating until I know exactly what users want, I create content marketing with real ROI.
    </p>
    <p>My clients range from a small leadership development firm to a mid-sized development shop to a large education provider. The scope of the digital strategy may change, but my process always stays the same: match the business goals to the users, then match the users to their behaviors. With that I can create content governance documents to establish a brand voice, an information architecture to outline the content strategy and copy to execute a digital marketing plan. Once I get a brand talking to its users, returns start flowing.
</p>
    <p>
I’m always happy to discuss client work in private, but for work that’s not ghostwritten, I have plenty to show. Working with The Onion, Crain’s Chicago Business and The Chicago Sun-Times taught me how to build loyalty with authentic, valuable content. I keep up that practice with <a href="http://gethustl.in/" target="_blank">Get Hustlin’</a>, the career brand I co-founded with a colleague. We use precise curation and a tightly controlled voice to build a devoted following of users who need confidence just as badly as they need a new job. I also continue to write for a variety of outlets, focusing on the kind of journalism that lets me break complicated topics down into human stories — a skill that carries over into my client work. Here are a few examples:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160115/ISSUE03/160119887/how-to-save-a-downtown" target="_blank">How Griffith, Ind. saved its downtown</a></li>
