<h1>SARAH COLLINS</h1>
<h2>Journalism | Content Strategy | Audience Development</h2>
    <p>I help companies talk to their users. Using research, analytics and social listening, I create content that's driven by user insights. Then I package it up and push it out to the audience we want to reach. Currently I'm part of a cross-disciplinary team working within Wrapports to help our brands reach new audiences. In six months we've built a new site to help young Chicagoans explore their city and a portal that allows us to test how we package the best reporting in the city.</p>
    <p>Before that, I created a tip to tail digital strategy for Grid that helped the niche business publication reach a monthly audience of 130,000 savvy Chicagoans with little budget and no marketing. Before that I introduced analytics and descriptive headlines to The A.V. Club, The Onion's entertainment sister site, and implemented a social strategy to maximize audience. I then helped brands create content campaigns to reach that audience, and I used what I learned to push The Onion toward a social strategy that teased content rather than giving it all away.</p>

<p>I'm looking for companies that appreciate a multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving and content creation. Mostly because it's real fun, but also because it's the only way to get shit done. If that sounds like something you're interested in, hit me up here ...  </p>
