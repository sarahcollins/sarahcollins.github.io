    <h2>Digital Strategy | Content Creation | Audience Development</h2>
    
    <p>
For me, digital strategy is all about going where the reader lives. Social, local, mobile is a nice set of buzzwords, but when you’re building a lifestyle brand for Chicago millennials, it’s also an obvious set of circumstances you have to accommodate. I’m currently trying to build a brand that’s nothing more than a newsletter and a <a href="https://twitter.com/GetHustlin" target="_blank">Twitter account</a>, so we don’t waste time trying to pull people out of environments they’re already in.
    </p>
    <p>
When I started at The A.V. Club, the company was relying on a dedicated but dwindling core of superusers to drive traffic, with almost no plan for distributing our content to a wider audience. I introduced analytics to a team that had been data-averse, swapped <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/kyle-kinane-51805" target="_blank">performer’s names</a> for <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/emthe-simpsonsem-and-sexual-metaphors-this-week-on-89324" target="_blank">social</a>-<a href="http://www.avclub.com/video/emmad-menem-em30-rockem-and-an-allusion-within-an--73149" target="_blank">friendly</a> headlines, and pushed us into new nerd-friendly social networks like <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/emthe-av-clubem-joins-tumblr-becomes-hip-62208" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, where we quickly amassed hundreds of thousands of followers. The result was massive growth where we had been stagnating, and a set of strategies that are still in place today.</p>

Content creation should always start with a headline. If you can’t write the headline, you don’t have a story, and you certainly don’t know whether it’s a story anyone wants to read. Editing let me write <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/business-2/grid/chicago-indie-gaming-octodad-organ-trail/" target="_blank">a</a> <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/business-2/grid/cards-against-humanity-game-money/" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/business-2/grid/wilcos-jeff-tweedy-learned-grow-start-firing-friends/" target="_blank">headlines</a> I desperately love, but these are ones where I created the content as well.

I develop audiences the same way I make friends — by using my voice to be honest and engaging. At Grid, we spoke to the office worker who expected so much more in return for all his college over-achieving. To serve him, we adopted a smart and funny voice that let us break down businesses into component parts that could be aced like so many tests. By making business relatable and comprehensible to people who were looking to level-up in their careers, we built a loyal audience of 130,000 monthly uniques in eight months with no marketing.

    <p>
Years of watching social reactions and tracking user analytics have left me with a good understanding of the gap between what people say and what they do. I use that knowledge to make sense of user surveys and market research in ways that people disconnected from the day-to-day cannot. I want to humanize data, so a generic millennial audience becomes a Michael Kors watch-wearing, cracked-screen iPhone-toting reader who goes to Lollapalooza but doesn't want to use the porta-potties. If that sounds like something your business is looking for, please get in touch.
